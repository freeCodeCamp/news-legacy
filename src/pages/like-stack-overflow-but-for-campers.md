# Like Stack Overflow, but for campers

About a year ago, we launched our community forum. Today, thousands of campers use it each day to share insights and get help.

Here are some of the useful things you can do there:

1.  You can ask a question about anything. Then you can read other campers’ replies. If a reply answers your question, you can mark it as the solution.
2.  You can [get feedback on projects you’ve built](https://fcc.im/2qxH5PQ).
3.  You can [read about campers who’ve gotten their first developer job](https://fcc.im/2rsiP0U), and their coding journeys so far.

You can even see which campers have been most helpful each week on our [leaderboard](https://fcc.im/2qTi05a).

We have a powerful search engine and thousands of topics, so you can find discussions about pretty much everything on there.

If you already have a GitHub account, [it only takes a few seconds to join](https://fcc.im/2pVp3WU).

### Here are three links worth your time:

1.  Lessons from history’s great innovators that you should never forget ([4 minute read](https://fcc.im/2qTptBl))
2.  How I fell in love with the OpenBSD operating system ([4 minute read](https://fcc.im/2pVu6GB))
3.  Write safer and cleaner code by leveraging the power of immutability ([4 minute read](https://fcc.im/2pVCuWN))

### Thought of the day:

> “Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.” — Ray Ozzie
