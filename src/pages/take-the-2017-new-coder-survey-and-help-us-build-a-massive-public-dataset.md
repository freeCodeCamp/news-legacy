# We’re building a massive public dataset about new coders

Today we’re launching the 2017 New Coder Survey — an anonymous survey of thousands of people who started coding less than 5 years ago. You can [take the survey here](http://bit.ly/2017-new-coder-survey).

Last year, more than 15,000 people responded to our 2016 survey. This granted researchers and journalists an unprecedented glimpse into how people are learning to code.

We released the entire dataset of participants’ individual responses to all 48 questions — under the Open Data Common License — on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey).

Then something magical happened. Dozens of data scientists started exploring the data and making all kinds of discoveries. On Kaggle alone, data scientists published [more than 50 reports](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/2016-new-coder-survey-/kernels).

We learned a lot from the experience, and have further streamlined our survey. If you have 5 minutes, help researchers understand where you’re coming from. [Take the survey](http://bit.ly/2017-new-coder-survey).

*   It’s fun.
*   It’s completely anonymous.
*   All the questions are 100% optional (you can just scroll right past any questions you don’t feel like answering)

Even if you’ve already been coding for more than 5 years, you can still help by telling your friends.
