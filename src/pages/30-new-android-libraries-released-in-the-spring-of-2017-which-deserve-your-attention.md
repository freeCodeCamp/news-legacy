These are my 30 favorite new Android libraries that have come out since March 2017\. Some of them aren’t production ready yet, but you may have **lots of fun** using them. I hope you enjoy these.

Here they are in no particular order:

#### 1\. [Matisse](https://github.com/zhihu/Matisse)

This is a beautiful local images and videos selector. Main functionalities:

*   Selecting images including JPEG, PNG, GIF and videos including MPEG, MP4,
*   applying custom themes, including two built-in ones,
*   different image loaders,
*   defining custom filter rules,
*   fully operational within `Activities` and `Fragments`.

You can find more in the lib’s [wiki](https://github.com/zhihu/Matisse/wiki).

#### 2\. [Spruce Android Animation Library](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/spruce-android)

> Spruce is a lightweight animation library that helps choreograph the animations on the screen. With so many different animation libraries out there, developers need to make sure that each view is animating at the appropriate time. Spruce can help designers request complex multi-view animations and not have the developers cringe at the prototype.

#### 3\. [MaterialChipsInput](https://github.com/pchmn/MaterialChipsInput)

Chips were presented in Material Design. They

> represent complex entities in small blocks, such as a contact. A chip may contain entities such as a photo, text, rules, an icon, or a contact.

MaterialChipsInput is an implementation of that component for Android. The library provides two views : `[ChipsInput](https://github.com/pchmn/MaterialChipsInput#chipsinput)` and `[ChipView](https://github.com/pchmn/MaterialChipsInput#chipview)`.

#### 4\. [Grav](https://github.com/glomadrian/Grav)

This library allows to create multiple animations based on points. Take a look — how smooth and beautiful animations you can make quite easily. _README_ contains a lot of examples so you might check it [here](https://github.com/glomadrian/Grav).





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*rlnQZT8T78QOBCdi5FwCRQ.gif?q=20)

_Grav - Configurable animations based on points_github.com](https://github.com/glomadrian/Grav "https://github.com/glomadrian/Grav")[](https://github.com/glomadrian/Grav)

#### 5\. [Litho](https://github.com/facebook/litho)

Litho is not a library, it is a framework. A really powerful framework to build UI in a declarative way. It was developed by Facebook devs, so even if you do not want to try it, still it is worthy to observe and follow a development process.





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*DGgTaK04UhsTY4gqp05mMA.png?q=20)

<canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="72"></canvas>

<noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*DGgTaK04UhsTY4gqp05mMA.png"&gt;</noscript>







Main features include:

*   using a declarative API to define UI components. You simply describe the layout for your UI based on a set of immutable inputs and the framework takes care of the rest.
*   Asynchronous layout: Litho can measure and layout your UI ahead of time without blocking the UI thread.
*   View flattening: Litho uses [Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/) for layout and automatically reduces the number of ViewGroups that your UI contains.
*   Fine-grained recycling: Any component such as a text or image can be recycled and reused anywhere in the UI.

[**facebook/litho**  
_litho - A declarative framework for building efficient UIs on Android._github.com](https://github.com/facebook/litho "https://github.com/facebook/litho")[](https://github.com/facebook/litho)

#### 6\. [Adaptable Bottom Navigation](https://github.com/bufferapp/AdaptableBottomNavigation)

Some time ago Google updated Material Design guideline, and introduced bottom navigation bars, as one of several good UI patters to follow in our apps. They also added the implementation to the Design Support Library.





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*sha-uKiRhrSOsRDo5RZe5w.png?q=20)

<canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="73"></canvas>

<noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sha-uKiRhrSOsRDo5RZe5w.png"&gt;</noscript>







Adaptable Bottom Navigation can easily replace `BottomNavigationView` from Support Library. It is implemented in the way how `ViewPager` and `TabLayout` work. This is a short explanation from Buffer team:

> As mentioned, when using the Bottom Navigation View from the Android Support Library, there can be a lot of boilerplate code for the switching of views. Because of this, we took inspiration from the TabLayout setupWithViewPager() method and created a custom ViewSwapper component that can be attached to a Bottom Navigation View to simplify the management of view display.

You can read more on Github. There is a quite comprehensive documentation and explanation why it was implemented (tip: clean architecture 🚀 ).

#### 7\. [PatternLockView](https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView)

> This library allows you to implement pattern locking mechanism in your app easily and quickly. It is very easy to use and there are plenty of customization options available to change the functionality and look-and-feel of this view to match your needs.

> It also supports RxJava 2 view bindings, so if you are a fan of reactive programming (just like me), you can get a stream of updates as the user draws the pattern.

The _README_ is full of examples, so it is easy to start with the library.

#### 8\. [Isometric](https://github.com/FabianTerhorst/Isometric)

This is a library which helps to draw isometric shapes. In my opinion, it is one of the coolest libraries in that list, as it reminds me of [Monument Valley](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ustwo.monumentvalley) game.   
The library supports drawing multiple shapes, paths and complex structures, like the example below.

#### 9\. [UltraViewPager](https://github.com/alibaba/UltraViewPager)

We can treat this library as a `ViewPager` extension that encapsulates many features, mainly to provide a unified solution for multi-page switching scenarios.





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Ara4N3vAGmrAJk7Q9QqWOg.gif?q=20)

#### UltraViewPager supports:

*   horizontal scrolling and vertical scrolling,
*   multi views in one `ViewPager`
*   switching views circularly. For example, if there are 3 views to display in a `ViewPager`, it should switch back to the first view after the third view,
*   auto-scrolling feature (implemented timer using `Handler`),
*   setting max-height and max-width,
*   setting the aspect ratio,
*   indicating the view we are currently (circle and icon),
*   built-in two kinds of page transition animations.

This library has a good documentation as well.

#### 11\. [SlidingRootNav](https://github.com/yarolegovich/SlidingRootNav)

This is a library which we can consider as a DrawerLayout-like `ViewGroup`, where a _drawer_ is hidden under the content view, and then can be shifted to make the drawer visible. _REAMDE_ is quite comprehensive and it is worthy to check for sure.

#### 26\. [ViewPagerAnimator](https://github.com/StylingAndroid/ViewPagerAnimator)

> _ViewPagerAnimator_ is a new lightweight, yet powerful _ViewPager_ animation library for Android. it is designed to animate arbitrary values as the user navigates between pages within a _ViewPager_, and will precisely follow the motion of h[is|er] finger. Although the library itself may be of use to some, the main purpose of publishing this library is to demonstrate some wonderful API subtleties which really come to the fore when using Java 8 extensions which are coming our way soon. Sample projects for both Java 7 and Java 8 are provided.

It is written by [Mark Allison](https://medium.com/@MarkIAllison) and you can get more info on his [Styling Android blog](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/viewpageranimator-the-basics/).
