Here are three links worth your time:

1.  This weekend Bill Gates and Elon Musk both warned us about the one thing politicians are too scared to talk about: automation ([4 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lwufB8))
2.  How to make your Tic Tac Toe game unbeatable by using the minimax algorithm ([8 minute read](http://bit.ly/2lyYub8))
3.  A collection of repeatable SVG background patterns for you to use on your web projects ([1 minute browse](http://bit.ly/2m0NNLN))

### Thought of the day:

> The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining.” — Stephen Hawking

### Image of the day:

Artist Scott Campbell [programmed a laser cutter](http://bit.ly/2lZlXPV) to carve a skull out of a two-foot stack of $11,000 worth in uncut US dollar bills.
