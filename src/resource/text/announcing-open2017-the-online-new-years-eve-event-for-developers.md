New Year’s fireworks over Hong Kong







Here are a few reasons to stay home this New Year’s Eve:

*   It’s the worst day of the year for [fatal drunk driving deaths](http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/jan-1-is-worst-day-for-drunken-driving-analysis-shows/)
*   It’s crowded
*   It’s freaking cold

Time’s Square during last year’s New Year’s Eve celebration, packed with brave souls who can go all night without a bathroom break.







And most importantly, if you go out, you’ll miss #Open2017.

#Open2017 is a 4-hour interactive live stream — for developers, by developers.

We’ll get started one hour before the ball drops in New York City, then continue streaming until midnight in San Francisco.

That’s right — we’re going to ring in the new year 4 times — each time with exciting new guests:
