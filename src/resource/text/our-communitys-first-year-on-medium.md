# The data behind our community’s first year on Medium







![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HodyA0fLyaqJ29p5FFBUpw.png)







About one year ago, we shut down our open source community’s blog and moved everyone over to Medium.

Since then, on this Medium publication,

*   **214 contributors**
*   have published **460 stories**
*   which have each been viewed an **average of 17,000 times**.

Our community’s publication now gets more than a million views per month.







Half of all the stories we’ve published have been viewed at least 5,000 times.

An average of nearly 27,000 people visit our community’s Medium publication every day.







Over 12 months, our community publication — which focuses on development, design, and data science — has become the [12th largest Medium publication](https://toppub.xyz/), and the largest technical one.

Readers spent more than 7 million minutes reading our publication over the past 3 months.







How did our community’s publication manage to grow so quickly?

### Reason #1: Deep thinkers who are good at writing

Hundreds of developers, designers, and data scientists — who share our vision of open source education — have published stories here.
