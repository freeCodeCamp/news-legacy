# How open source textbooks are reducing the cost of college

Over the past 10 years, the cost of textbooks in the US has increased by 88%. This has contributed to more than $1 trillion in total student loan debt, which Americans are struggling pay back.

Now university systems are turning to a powerful cost-savings tool: open source.

The University of Maryland is giving out grants to “faculty who are adopting, adapting or scaling the use of OER [open educational resources] in Fall 2017 through high-enrollment courses where quality OER exists.”

You can browse some of the wide array of open source computer science textbooks [here](https://fcc.im/2pA7lLR).
